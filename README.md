This repository presents a CSV dataset intended for the research and development of advanced predictive models for traffic optimization in self-adaptive data networks. The main contribution of this study lies in the design and implementation of a comprehensive approach based on machine learning and deep learning models for early anomaly detection and efficient network traffic management.
This dataset has been compiled and structured to provide a reliable basis for research in network traffic optimization. The proposal incorporates various algorithms with activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, exponential, softmax, hard sigmoid, and MISH, to evaluate their effectiveness in automatically identifying anomalous patterns and improving network performance.
The dataset includes key variables extracted from measurements in real networks, allowing for the exploration of traffic patterns and optimization of information flow. The information contained in this dataset has been structured to facilitate its application in various machine and deep learning strategies. To build and validate the predictive models, multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms were explored. In particular, various neural network architectures were trained and analyzed to determine the most efficient combination for predicting and controlling network traffic. The following techniques were compared and evaluated:

1. Supervised learning algorithms
2. Neural networks with different activation functions
3. Evaluation of the efficiency and error rate of each model

The analysis and evaluation process allowed us to select the best models for early problem detection in self-adaptive networks, thus contributing to improved data traffic management and control.

This dataset is available to the research community and anyone interested in developing advanced solutions for network traffic optimization.
